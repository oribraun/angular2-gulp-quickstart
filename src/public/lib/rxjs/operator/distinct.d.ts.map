If a keySelector function is not provided, it will use each value from the\n * source observable directly with an equality check against previous values.\n * In JavaScript runtimes that support `Set`, this operator will use a `Set` to improve performance of the distinct value checking.\n * In other runtimes, this operator will use a minimal implementation of `Set` that relies on an `Array` and `indexOf` under the\n * hood, so performance will degrade as more values are checked for distinction. Even in newer browsers, a long-running `distinct`\n * use might result in memory leaks. To help alleviate this in some scenarios, an optional `flushes` parameter is also provided so\n * that the internal `Set` can be \"flushed\", basically clearing it of values.\n * @param {function} [keySelector] optional function to select which value you want to check as distinct.\n * @param {Observable} [flushes] optional Observable for flushing the internal HashSet of the operator.\n * @return {Observable} an Observable that emits items from the source Observable with distinct values.\n * @method distinct\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport declare function distinct<T, K>(this: Observable<T>, keySelector?: (value: T) => K, flushes?: Observable<any>): Observable<T>;\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nexport declare class DistinctSubscriber<T, K> extends OuterSubscriber<T, T> {\n    private keySelector;\n    private values;\n    constructor(destination: Subscriber<T>, keySelector: (value: T) => K, flushes: Observable<any>);\n    notifyNext(outerValue: T, innerValue: T, outerIndex: number, innerIndex: number, innerSub: InnerSubscriber<T, T>): void;\n    notifyError(error: any, innerSub: InnerSubscriber<T, T>): void;\n    protected _next(value: T): void;\n    private _useKeySelector(value);\n    private _finalizeNext(key, value);\n}\n"],"file":"rxjs/operator/distinct.d.ts","sourceRoot":"/source/"}
