Each time it observes one of these emitted inner\n * Observables, the output Observable begins emitting the items emitted by that\n * inner Observable. So far, it behaves like {@link mergeAll}. However,\n * `exhaust` ignores every new inner Observable if the previous Observable has\n * not yet completed. Once that one completes, it will accept and flatten the\n * next inner Observable and repeat this process.\n *\n * @example <caption>Run a finite timer for each click, only if there is no currently active timer</caption>\n * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * var higherOrder = clicks.map((ev) => Rx.Observable.interval(1000));\n * var result = higherOrder.exhaust();\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link concatAll}\n * @see {@link switch}\n * @see {@link mergeAll}\n * @see {@link exhaustMap}\n * @see {@link zipAll}\n *\n * @return {Observable} Returns an Observable that takes a source of Observables\n * and propagates the first observable exclusively until it completes before\n * subscribing to the next.\n * @method exhaust\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport declare function exhaust<T>(this: Observable<T>): Observable<T>;\n"],"file":"rxjs/operator/exhaust.d.ts","sourceRoot":"/source/"}
